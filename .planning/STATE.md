# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Produce actionable, adoption-realistic implementation specs for Aera skills -- not just technically feasible ones, but ones real users will actually adopt.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Project Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Project Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-10 -- Completed 01-01 (project scaffold + hierarchy schemas)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 3min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 5 files |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min
- Trend: starting

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases derived from 44 requirements at fine granularity. Scoring split into engine (Phase 4) and output (Phase 5) to allow prompt calibration before report generation. Knowledge base bundled early (Phase 2) so scoring and simulation can reference real Aera components.
- [Phase 01]: Enum values corrected to match actual export data: ai_suitability uses NOT_APPLICABLE (not NONE), impact_order limited to FIRST|SECOND, lead_archetype/implementation_complexity/ai_suitability are nullable
- [Phase 01]: Node.js built-in test runner (node:test) chosen over external frameworks for zero-dependency testing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Qwen 2.5 32B structured JSON output reliability needs empirical testing in Phase 4
- [Research]: Ollama model lifecycle management (load/unload) needs verification in Phase 7
- [Research]: Apple Silicon thermal behavior during sustained 6-hour inference is unknown
