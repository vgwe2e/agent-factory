## 2026-03-10 — Session 1

### Finding: Job Posting Scam Detector
- **Source**: Reddit (r/jobs, r/scams), FlexJobs survey, Indeed career advice, Hacker News
- **Signal**: 4 in 10 Americans received job scam texts in 2025 (Resume.org survey). LinkedIn job scams surging in 2026. AI-generated fake postings increasingly sophisticated. Constant complaints on Reddit about fake listings.
- **Current solutions**: Norton Genie (generic scam detector, not job-specific). Resumly AI (paid). Manual checklist articles. No free, focused, AI-powered job posting analyzer.
- **Agent design**: Tool 1 (GATHER): web_fetch to grab job posting page. Tool 2 (PROCESS): web_search to verify company existence, check domain, find reviews. Tool 3 (OUTPUT): file_write risk report with specific red flags.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 1 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 3/3
- **Status**: built (venture 6/6)
- **Notes**: Broad audience. Emotional appeal. Very testable — paste a URL, get a risk score. Red flags: vague descriptions, unrealistic salary, grammar issues, missing company info, generic email domains, payment requests. BUILD: TypeScript clean, Next.js build passes. 3 specialized tools: fetch_job_posting, verify_employer, generate_risk_report.

### Finding: Dependency Changelog Summarizer
- **Source**: DEV Community, npm/Renovate docs, HN developer tool wishes
- **Signal**: "Updating packages leads to questioning career choices at 2 AM." Developers miss breaking changes constantly. Dependabot/Renovate create PRs but don't summarize what changed.
- **Current solutions**: Dependabot (creates PRs, no summaries). Renovate Bot (same). Manual changelog reading. GitHub releases page (per-repo visits).
- **Agent design**: Tool 1 (GATHER): file_read package.json, web_fetch GitHub release notes. Tool 2 (PROCESS): Summarize changelogs, highlight breaking changes, rate urgency. Tool 3 (OUTPUT): file_write structured update report.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 1 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 3/3
- **Status**: built (venture 6/6)
- **Notes**: Clear gap vs existing tools. Dependabot tells you WHAT to update, not WHY or what breaks. Works with any package manager. BUILD: TypeScript clean, Next.js build passes. 3 tools: scan_dependencies, fetch_changelogs, write_update_report.

### Finding: GitHub Repo Health Scanner
- **Source**: GitHub topics (readme-score), NxCode tool, HN discussions
- **Signal**: Developers evaluate repos before adopting. Common: Is it maintained? Good docs? Active community? Responsive to issues?
- **Current solutions**: NxCode web tool (limited). GitHub Code Quality (preview, own repos only). readme-score (outdated). Manual evaluation (slow).
- **Agent design**: Tool 1 (GATHER): web_fetch GitHub repo page + API. Tool 2 (PROCESS): Score health (README, commits, issues, stars, license, CI). Tool 3 (OUTPUT): file_write health report.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 1 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 3/3
- **Status**: built (venture 6/6)
- **Notes**: Useful for any developer evaluating dependencies. Also for maintainers improving their repos. BUILD: TypeScript clean, Next.js build passes. 3 tools: fetch_repo_info, analyze_community, write_health_report.

### Finding: Landing Page Copy Auditor
- **Source**: Reddit (r/webdev, r/entrepreneur), HN, indie hacker communities
- **Signal**: Common pain — people want landing page feedback.
- **Current solutions**: Roastd.io (free). NxCode (free tier). Multiple free options emerging.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: deferred
- **Notes**: Gap closing fast. Roastd.io already does this well for free.

### Finding: Content Repurposer (Blog to Social)
- **Source**: Reddit marketing communities, Sprout Social
- **Signal**: 94% of marketers repurpose content.
- **Current solutions**: Planable (free, unlimited). Repurpose.io. Many free options.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Market saturated. Planable offers this free and unlimited.

### Finding: TOS/Privacy Policy Change Monitor
- **Source**: VentureBeat, TechCrunch, general web
- **Signal**: People care when TOS changes but specific tool request is niche.
- **Current solutions**: Visualping (general). TOSBack (shut down). No focused free tracker.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 0 | GAP: 1 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: deferred
- **Notes**: Gap exists but signal is weak.

### Finding: Freelance Contract Red Flag Reviewer
- **Source**: HN, Reddit freelancer communities
- **Signal**: Freelancers worry about contracts. Commercial tools expensive.
- **Current solutions**: Spellbook, Ironclad, goHeather (all expensive/enterprise).
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Doesn't leverage tools — just LLM text analysis. Base harness already does this.

## 2026-03-10 — Session 1 (Round 2)

### Finding: Company Briefing Generator (Interview Prep)
- **Source**: Reddit (r/jobs, r/cscareerquestions), The Interview Guys, Ohio State career services, Scale.jobs
- **Signal**: Every job seeker needs to research companies before interviews. Multiple guides (OSU, InterviewGuys) confirm this is standard advice. Reddit career communities constantly discuss this. People manually check 5-6 sources (website, Glassdoor, Crunchbase, news, LinkedIn, funding).
- **Current solutions**: Manual research (tedious, 15-20 min per company). No automated "one-click company briefing" tool exists. Glassdoor gives reviews but not a complete briefing. Crunchbase gives funding but requires account.
- **Agent design**: Tool 1 (GATHER): web_fetch company website + careers page. Tool 2 (PROCESS): web_search for Glassdoor reviews, recent news, funding, key people, culture. Tool 3 (OUTPUT): file_write one-page briefing with talking points.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 1 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 3/3
- **Status**: built (venture 6/6)
- **Notes**: Great companion to job-scam-detector. Same audience (job seekers). Extremely practical — saves 15-20 min of manual research per interview. Output is immediately usable.

### Finding: Startup Idea Validator
- **Source**: ValidatorAI, IdeaProof, FounderPal, DimeADozen, Reddit indie hacker communities
- **Signal**: Very high demand from indie hackers and entrepreneurs.
- **Current solutions**: ValidatorAI (free), IdeaProof (free), FounderPal (free), DimeADozen (free). Market is saturated with free tools.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: At least 5 free tools already do this well. No differentiation possible.

### Finding: Brand Mention Monitor
- **Source**: Reddit, Gumloop blog, marketing communities
- **Signal**: Small businesses want to track brand mentions.
- **Current solutions**: Google Alerts (free), Octolens, Alertly, Awario, BrandMentions. Well-served market.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Google Alerts is free and sufficient for most use cases.

### Finding: Email Deliverability Checker
- **Source**: Various spam check tool websites
- **Signal**: Email marketers care about deliverability.
- **Current solutions**: mail-tester.com, MailGenius, TestMailScore, IPQS, Unspam.email — all free.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Extremely well-served. 10+ free tools exist.

### Finding: Accessibility Audit Agent
- **Source**: W3C, AccessibilityChecker.org, WCAG compliance guides
- **Signal**: High regulatory pressure (European Accessibility Act June 2025, US gov April 2026).
- **Current solutions**: AccessibilityChecker.org, WAVE, axe, accessScan — many free tools.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Strong signal but gap is zero. Many mature free tools.

## Meta-Reflection — After builds 1-4

### What's working
- **GATHER → PROCESS → OUTPUT pattern is reliable.** Every agent follows the same 3-tool structure and it maps cleanly to real workflows.
- **Web search + web fetch is powerful.** DuckDuckGo HTML search + Readability content extraction cover most information-gathering needs without API keys.
- **Job seeker tools have high emotional appeal.** The job-scam-detector and company-briefing-agent are in the same "job seeker toolkit" and both generate README-worthy excitement. People FEEL the pain.
- **Developer tools build fast.** The dep-changelog-summarizer and repo-health-scanner use public APIs (npm, GitHub) that are well-structured and easy to parse.
- **Build process is smooth.** Copy seed, write 3 tools + config + route + README, type-check, build. Under 15 minutes per agent.

### What keeps failing
- **Most ideas are already well-served.** Out of 12 problems researched, only 4 had a real gap. The majority are saturated: landing page auditors, content repurposers, email spam checkers, business name generators, accessibility auditors, startup validators. Free tools are everywhere.
- **Reddit-specific tools are risky.** GummySearch shut down because Reddit denied API access. Any agent relying on Reddit data faces the same risk.
- **"Just LLM analysis" agents don't need the harness.** The contract reviewer idea failed because it's just text in → text out. The harness adds value when the TOOLS gather external data.

### Adjusted strategy
- **Focus on problems where data gathering is the bottleneck.** The harness excels when the agent needs to fetch from multiple web sources, cross-reference, and synthesize. Pure text analysis can be done in any chatbot.
- **Look for "compound search" problems.** Where someone would normally open 5+ tabs to research something, that's the sweet spot. Both the company-briefing and job-scam-detector hit this.
- **Explore B2B / developer tooling more.** The repo-health-scanner and dep-changelog-summarizer have the clearest tool utility. More developer-facing agents might score well.
- **Consider agents that use the GitHub API specifically.** It's free, well-documented, and data-rich. More can be built on top of it.
- **Try a different domain next.** 2 of 4 agents are job-seeker tools. Diversify into SaaS/business intelligence or developer ops.

## 2026-03-10 — Session 1 (Round 3)

### Finding: npm Package Trust Checker
- **Source**: Veracode blog, Shai-Hulud worm analysis, OWASP npm security cheat sheet, BrightCoding audit playbook, HackerNews
- **Signal**: Malicious npm packages surged to 2,168 reports in 2024, Snyk found 3,000+ in 2024 alone. Shai-Hulud worm (Sep+Nov 2025) backdoored 796 packages with 20M weekly downloads. CISA issued an alert. Typosquatting is rampant (@acitons/artifact got 206K downloads). Supply chain security is a top developer concern.
- **Current solutions**: npm audit (post-install only, CVEs only). npq (CLI, blocks on heuristics but requires install). Socket CLI (paid for teams). Snyk (free tier limited). OSSF Scorecard (GitHub-focused, complex). No simple "paste a package name, get a trust report" web tool.
- **Agent design**: Tool 1 (GATHER): Fetch npm registry data (downloads, versions, maintainers, publish dates). Tool 2 (PROCESS): Search for CVEs, check GitHub repo health, look for malicious behavior reports. Tool 3 (OUTPUT): Write a trust report with score and install recommendation.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 1 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 3/3
- **Status**: built (venture 6/6)
- **Notes**: Extremely timely given recent supply chain attacks. Developer-focused (diversifies from job-seeker tools). Uses both npm registry API and GitHub API — perfect for the harness.

### Finding: GitHub Issue Triage Agent
- **Source**: GitHub Agentic Workflows (Jan 2026), Dosu.dev, Probot, GitHub Docs
- **Signal**: Maintainers report 50-100 emails daily. Issue triage is a major pain.
- **Current solutions**: GitHub just launched AI issue triage workflow (Jan 2026). Dosu.dev automates this. Probot has a triage app. Multiple solutions emerging fast.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: GitHub's own AI triage launched in Jan 2026. Gap closed. Too many competitors entering.

### Finding: Twitter Thread Unroller
- **Source**: UnrollNow, ThreadReader, etc.
- **Signal**: Common need.
- **Current solutions**: UnrollNow, ThreadReader, PingThread, Twittethread, Xunroll — all free.

### Finding: arXiv Paper Summarizer
- **Source**: Emergent Mind, HN Show HN posts
- **Signal**: Researchers and developers want simplified paper explanations.
- **Current solutions**: Emergent Mind (free), semantic arXiv search tools, ChatGPT (general).
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: deferred
- **Notes**: Emergent Mind does this well. Could revisit with a more specific angle (e.g., "explain this paper for a product manager").

- **Signal**: Small businesses want content ideas.
- **Current solutions**: Buffer (free tier), ContentStudio, Hootsuite, Planable, Canva content planner — all have free tiers.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Extremely saturated market. Multiple mature free tools.

### Finding: API Mock/Test Endpoint Generator
- **Source**: Web search for developer API testing tools
- **Signal**: Developers need mock APIs for testing.
- **Current solutions**: Mockoon (free, open source), Beeceptor (free tier), Postman mock servers, WireMock, json-server. Many free options.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Well-served by multiple open source tools.

### Finding: Tech Stack Detector
- **Source**: Web search for website technology detection tools
- **Signal**: Developers and marketers want to know what technologies a website uses.
- **Current solutions**: Wappalyzer (free extension), BuiltWith (free tier), Hexomatic, Stackcrawler, SEOmator, Enricher.io — extremely mature market.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: BuiltWith has been doing this since 2007. Wappalyzer browser extension is free and excellent. No gap.

### Finding: License Compatibility Checker
- **Source**: GitHub (FLICT, Licensetry), npm (license-checker, license-report), Google js-green-licenses
- **Signal**: Developers care about license compliance, especially in enterprise.
- **Current solutions**: license-checker (npm, free), LicenseFinder (multi-language, free), FLICT (free), Google js-green-licenses (free). All CLI tools but widely available.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Multiple free CLI tools exist. Web version would add convenience but core problem is solved.

### Finding: SaaS Pricing Change Tracker
- **Source**: SaaS Price Pulse, SaaStr pricing analysis
- **Signal**: High — 1,800+ pricing changes across top 500 SaaS in 2025 alone. 20% average price increases.
- **Current solutions**: SaaS Price Pulse launched Jan 2026. Tracks 260+ SaaS pages with AI extraction and Slack/email alerts.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: SaaS Price Pulse already does exactly this. Gap closed in Jan 2026.

### Finding: Code Review Assistant
- **Source**: DEV Community, DigitalOcean, Augment Code roundups
- **Signal**: Every developer wants better PR reviews.
- **Current solutions**: CodeRabbit, Copilot, Graphite, Greptile, BugBot, Semgrep, SonarCloud, PR-Agent — extremely competitive space.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: One of the most competitive spaces in dev tools. GitHub Copilot alone covers this.

### Finding: Haunted Domain Checker (Domain Reputation Auditor)
- **Source**: HN thread "Before you buy a domain, first check to see if it's haunted" (400+ comments), GoDaddy 2026 guide, DomCop guide
- **Signal**: Real financial pain — people buy domains and discover they're blacklisted by Google, email servers, social media platforms, corporate firewalls. One HN user's organic search traffic "dropped to zero" after buying a haunted domain. FTC/spam filters retain old categorizations for years. Domain buyers routinely open 5+ tabs (Wayback Machine, VirusTotal, MxToolbox, Spamhaus, Google Safe Browsing) to vet a domain.
- **Current solutions**: Individual tools exist: MxToolbox (email/DNS), VirusTotal (malware), Wayback Machine (history), Spamhaus (spam), EasyDMARC (email reputation), IPVoid (blacklists). But each checks ONE dimension. No free tool runs ALL checks and produces a single consolidated "buy or skip" report. Paid tools (DomainTools, SEMrush, Ahrefs) offer some of this but cost $100+/month.
- **Agent design**: Tool 1 (GATHER): Fetch WHOIS/RDAP data, Wayback Machine CDX API for historical snapshots, DNS records. Tool 2 (PROCESS): Search for blacklists, malware reports, Google Safe Browsing status, email reputation, spam reports. Tool 3 (OUTPUT): Write a consolidated domain health report with buy/skip recommendation.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 1 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 3/3
- **Status**: built (venture 6/6)
- **Notes**: Classic compound search problem — users currently open 5+ tabs to research a domain. Perfect for the harness. Developer/webmaster audience diversifies from job seekers. All data sources are publicly accessible. HN thread had strong engagement. BUILD: TypeScript clean, Next.js build passes. 3 tools: fetch_domain_info (RDAP + Wayback CDX + DNS-over-HTTPS), check_domain_reputation (6 DuckDuckGo searches for blacklists/malware/phishing/spam/email/history), write_domain_report (scored 1-10 with buy/skip recommendation).

### Finding: Rental Listing Scam Detector
- **Source**: FTC consumer advice, CNBC, Zillow, ApartmentAdvisor
- **Signal**: 50% of rental scams reported to FTC started with fake Facebook ads. CNBC published "how to know if a rental listing is a scam" in Jan 2025. Real financial harm to renters.
- **Current solutions**: No free automated tool. Only manual checklists (FTC, Zillow guides). Scam-detector.com has articles but no automated analysis. Property records are county-specific and fragmented.
- **Agent design**: Tool 1 (GATHER): Fetch listing URL, extract address/price/contact info. Tool 2 (PROCESS): Verify address exists, search for landlord/management company, check phone/email against scam databases. Tool 3 (OUTPUT): Write risk report.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 1 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 3/3
- **Status**: built (venture 6/6)
- **Notes**: Strong emotional appeal, similar to job-scam-detector. Consumer audience. BUILD: TypeScript clean, Next.js build passes. 3 tools: fetch_rental_listing (URL fetch + platform risk analysis + text red flag scan), verify_rental_listing (address verification + landlord lookup + contact check + scam database search + price comparison), write_risk_assessment (risk score 1-10 with next steps and reporting resources).

### Finding: .env / Secrets Management
- **Source**: Security Boulevard, Doppler blog, GitGuardian
- **Signal**: GhostAction attack (Sep 2025) exposed 3,325 secrets across 817 GitHub repos. Real problem.
- **Current solutions**: Infisical (free, open source), Envault, EnvManager, Doppler, HashiCorp Vault. Well-served.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Infisical is free and open source. Gap closed.

## Meta-Reflection #2 — After builds 1-5

### Hit rate
- **Round 1**: 7 researched → 3 built (43%)
- **Round 2**: 5 researched → 1 built (20%)
- **Round 3**: 4 researched → 1 built (25%)
- **Round 4**: 9 researched → 2 queued (22%)
- **Overall**: 25 problems researched → 7 with 3/3 score (28%)

### Pattern: the "5-tab test"
Every successful agent passes the same test: "Would a person open 5+ browser tabs to solve this manually?" If yes, the harness adds real value by automating the compound search. If no, a chatbot already handles it.
- **Pass**: job-scam-detector (fetch listing + verify employer + scam reports), company-briefing (website + Glassdoor + news + funding + leadership), npm-trust-checker (registry + CVEs + repo + community), haunted-domain-checker (Wayback + blacklists + malware + email + DNS)
- **Fail**: contract reviewer (just text analysis), TOS summarizer (single page read), content repurposer (text transformation)

### What changed since reflection #1
- **Developer tools are the strongest category.** 3 of 5 built agents are developer-focused (dep-changelog, repo-health, npm-trust). They build fastest because the data sources (npm registry, GitHub API) are structured and predictable.
- **"Scam detector" is a repeatable template.** Job scams, rental scams, domain scams — the pattern is: fetch target → cross-reference → produce risk score. This is our strongest archetype.
- **GAP=0 remains the #1 kill reason.** 18 of 25 ideas died because free tools already exist. The market for simple AI-wrapped utilities is saturated. The harness wins when it GATHERS from multiple sources, not when it just analyzes text.
- **Build speed is consistent.** ~15 min per agent. The seed copy + 3 tools + config + route + README pattern is fully systematized.

### Adjusted strategy for next 5
- **Double down on the "scam detector" archetype.** Rental scam detector is queued. Could extend to: investment scam checker, e-commerce seller trustworthiness, charity verification.
- **Explore "pre-purchase research" broadly.** Domain checker, used car VIN check, contractor/plumber vetting — any domain where someone does manual multi-source research before spending money.
- **Try non-English-web data sources.** Government databases (FDA recalls, SEC filings, FCC complaints) are underutilized and freely accessible.
- **Consider agents that combine 2+ existing agent outputs.** E.g., a "full security audit" that chains npm-trust-checker + repo-health-scanner for comprehensive dependency review.

## 2026-03-10 — Session 2 (Round 5)

### Finding: Used Car VIN History Report
- **Source**: VinAudit, VinCheckUp, U.S. News, Edmunds
- **Signal**: Everyone buying a used car wants a VIN report.
- **Current solutions**: Carfax ($39.99), AutoCheck ($24.99), VinAudit ($9.99), NICB VINCheck (free), iSeeCars (free partial). Many options across price ranges.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 2/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: Very well-served market. Free NICB tool + multiple cheap alternatives.

### Finding: Contractor Due Diligence Agent
- **Source**: LicensedCheck, Angi, CSLB, BBB, homeowner forums
- **Signal**: Every homeowner researches contractors before hiring. Standard advice: check license, BBB, reviews, insurance. People open 5+ tabs: state license board, BBB, Google reviews, Yelp, Angi, NextDoor. Especially critical for expensive projects (roofing, plumbing, electrical).
- **Current solutions**: LicensedCheck (free, license verification across 50 states). BBB (free, complaints). Angi (free tier, reviews). Google Reviews. BUT each is a separate lookup. No single tool produces a consolidated "should I hire this contractor?" report combining license + BBB + reviews + complaints.
- **Agent design**: Tool 1 (GATHER): Search for the contractor/company across the web — find website, license info, BBB profile. Tool 2 (PROCESS): Verify license status, check BBB rating, aggregate reviews from Google/Yelp/Angi, search for complaints/lawsuits. Tool 3 (OUTPUT): Write a trust report with hire/avoid recommendation.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 1 | FEASIBLE: 1 | Total: 3/3
- **Status**: built (venture 6/6)
- **Notes**: Classic compound search pattern. Homeowner audience diversifies from dev + job seeker tools. BUILD: TypeScript clean, Next.js build passes. 3 tools: search_contractor (4 DuckDuckGo searches for web presence/license/BBB/reviews), verify_contractor (6 searches for complaints/lawsuits/insurance/history + website quality check), write_contractor_report (trust score 1-10 with hire/avoid recommendation + scam checklist).

### Finding: Investment / Crypto Scam Checker
- **Source**: FINRA BrokerCheck, SEC EDGAR, Bitget, SoFi

- **Current solutions**: FINRA BrokerCheck (free, comprehensive for registered). SEC EDGAR (free). Etherscan/Solscan (free for crypto). Gap mainly for unregistered schemes.
- **Score**: SIGNAL: 1 | GAP: 0 | FEASIBLE: 0 | Total: 1/3
- **Status**: rejected
- **Notes**: BrokerCheck is very comprehensive for registered investments. Can't programmatically access FINRA/SEC. Crypto verification is wallet-address-specific — different problem shape.

### Finding: Charity / Nonprofit Verification
- **Source**: IRS Tax Exempt Org Search, Charity Navigator, GuideStar, BBB Wise Giving
- **Signal**: Donors want to verify charities, especially after disasters.
- **Current solutions**: IRS TEOS (free, official), Charity Navigator (free), GuideStar (free), BBB Wise Giving Alliance (free). Extremely well-served.
